# Upgrading

Upgrades are relatively easy: stop the existing process, replace the binaries/Docker image, and start
it up again.

Some versions require mandatory configuration changes or have other restrictions preventing such an
easy upgrade. Check the notes in this section when upgrading to a newer version.

A rolling changelog is available [in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

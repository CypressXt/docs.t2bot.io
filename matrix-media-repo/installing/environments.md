# Intended environments

MMR is intended for high-traffic environments. Typically, these will be either large servers
or hosting providers where pooling media resources is ideal. Smaller homeservers can use MMR
as well, though they won't usually get the same benefits as larger deployments.

**Small/individual server owners should consider using their homeserver's built-in media repo
instead.** Deploying MMR can be complicated, and support rooms will assume basic fundamental
knowledge of reverse proxies and Matrix when diagnosing problems.

# Introduction

[matrix-media-repo](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo) (aka MMR) is a highly customizable
multi-domain media repository for Matrix. Intended for medium to large deployments, this media
repo de-duplicates media while being fully compliant with the Matrix specification.

Smaller/individual homeservers can still use this project, though it may be difficult to set
up or have higher than expected resource consumption. **If you're looking for an S3 connector,
please consider using [synapse-s3-storage-provider](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider)
instead.**

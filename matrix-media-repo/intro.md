# Introduction

[matrix-media-repo](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo) is a highly customizable
multi-domain media repository for Matrix. Intended for medium to large deployments, this media
repo de-duplicated media while being fully compliant with the specification.

Smaller/individual homeservers can still use this project, though it may be difficult to set
up or have higher than expected resource consumption.

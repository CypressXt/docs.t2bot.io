# Upgrading

Upgrading MMR is usually fairly easy: stop the existing process, replace the binaries/Docker
image, and start it back up again.

Some versions require mandatory configuration changes, or have other restrictions preventing
such an easy upgrade. Check the notes in this section when upgrading to a listed version.

A rolling changelog for MMR is available [here](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
